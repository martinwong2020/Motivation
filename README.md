# Inspiring Others Project:
### The project is coded using REACT which incorporates the use of Html, Css, and Javascript. The goal of the project is to spread uplifting messages to others and yourself in a simple and interactive way. The idea is to have people use the gumball machine to retreive motivational quote in an interactive way. They themselves can also donate inspiring quotes that will go inside the gumball machine. The project uses PouchDB to store the quotes and the quotes submitted by the users. 
# Status/Link:
