# Inspiring Others Project:
### The project is coded using REACT which incorporates the use of Html, Css, and Javascript. The goal of the project is to spread uplifting messages to others and yourself in a simple and interactive way. The idea is to have people submit inspiring messages in which others can get by trying the gumball machine. This is done by using PouchDB to store your inspirational quotes. The pouchDB will be stored on CouchDB for a remote database.
